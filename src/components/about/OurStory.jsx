            RITSware began as Ratham Innovation and Technology Solutions with a simple goal: make technology useful for real professionals.
            Over time, the team expanded to include doctors, engineers, HR and business experts — a multidisciplinary collective that builds solutions
            grounded in real-world workflows. That collaboration-first mindset shapes our products and research practices today.
